plane waves, attempt one to get rid of the resting 'stimulus' so that no spiral waves form unless hitting PV

based on number 7 with a few lines commented out towards the end

plane wave works, so now repeating it with oleg's change where for inexact number
refer back to 16, change in the if statement within the loop

EXACTLY THE SAME AS 20 BUT RUNNING FOR 6 HOURS

all works fine so now changed time of second plane wave to 0.04
