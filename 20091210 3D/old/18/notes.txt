plane waves, attempt one to get rid of the resting 'stimulus' so that no spiral waves form unless hitting PV

based on number 7 with a few lines commented out towards the end

plane wave works, so now repeating it not with oleg's change cos it didn't work, but just between 2<t<3

assume this won't work , our idea not oleg's 

surprisingly this gave a second stimulus but it did not propagate
